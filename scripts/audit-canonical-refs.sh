# --- Workstream I: non-canonical verb vocabulary -----------------------
# design-system.md §5 settled the operator-facing verbs for the OAuth
# approval flow + module-management. Surfaces using retired alternatives
# (Authorize / Allow / Grant / Approve-and-continue) drift the visual
# vocabulary and confuse operators flowing through the OAuth + module-
# management surfaces.
#
# Scoping decisions (per patterns#99 reviewer):
#   - `Connect` is NOT included in the verb-drift set. The audit caught
#     legitimate "Connect" usage in install.njk + the VaultPopover button
#     label — those describe vault-connection actions, not OAuth flow
#     verbs. design-system.md §5 doesn't claim authority over every
#     "connect" word in the product.
#   - parachute-notes (archiving) excluded so archived-repo hits don't
#     permanently noise the audit. parachute-agent is NO LONGER excluded
#     (2026-07-01): it's the live ex-channel module, and excluding it hid
#     live drift.
#   - Test files (`*.test.ts*`) excluded — assertions like
#     `expect(html).toContain("Authorize")` are pinning surface copy,
#     not driving drift. Cleanup of the surface flips the test
#     simultaneously.
#   - The match anchors are `>...<` (JSX/HTML text node), `aria-label=`,
#     and JSX `title=`/page-title constructions. Bare-quoted strings
#     are NOT matched — too many false positives from variable
#     assignments and intermediate constants. Result: catches user-
#     facing copy, misses internal symbol noise.

# the message formatter. A module carrying its own `brew install` /
# `apt-get install` / `dnf install` recipe, or a raw `Executable not found`
# literal, in `src/` is drift back to hand-synced strings — the exact thing
# the shared lib exists to prevent.
#
# Advisory, not a hard fail (like the rest of the script). Expected legitimate
# hits during the adoption arc: depcheck's own registry (packages/depcheck),
# vault's git-preflight.ts (being folded into depcheck), hub's
# cloudflaredInstallHint (the static-binary precedent) — these ARE the
# canonical sources and are excluded. Anything else is a candidate to route
# through depcheck.
